# Search-API
- have a problem to find job positions from API key given by Authenticjobs -> https://authenticjobs.com/api/docs#job-search;
- when typing location, job discription it showes all what it has but not filtered it for what I am asking for;
- Indeed 7 days waiting period. 
- other API do not works...or maybe I do not have knowledge in it.
